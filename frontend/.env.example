# Backend API Base URL Configuration
# 
# OPTION 1: Same-origin deployment (recommended)
# - Frontend and backend served from same domain
# - Leave empty to use relative URLs (works with /api/* routes)
# - Works with combined Vercel deployment
VITE_API_BASE=

# OPTION 2: Separate deployments
# - Frontend and backend on different domains
# - Set to full backend URL
# - Must configure CORS_ORIGINS on backend to allow frontend domain
# VITE_API_BASE=https://your-backend-url.vercel.app

# Local Development (with proxy)
# When running locally with Vite dev server, API requests are proxied to localhost:5000
# See vite.config.js for proxy configuration
