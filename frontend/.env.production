# Production Environment Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: Set VITE_API_BASE based on your deployment setup:
#
# OPTION 1: Same-origin deployment (recommended for Vercel combined deployment)
# - Frontend and backend served from same domain
# - Leave VITE_API_BASE empty to use relative URLs
# - Example: https://your-app.vercel.app serves both frontend and /api/*
VITE_API_BASE=
#
# OPTION 2: Separate deployments (frontend and backend on different domains)
# - Set VITE_API_BASE to your backend URL
# - Example: VITE_API_BASE=https://your-backend.vercel.app
# - Also set CORS_ORIGINS on backend to allow your frontend domain
